This package provides a framework to mix colors as pigments using the Kubelka-Munk model in a pigment-based color space.  

It also offers a way to decompose colors into components in arbitrary, user-specified pigment spaces, as well as offering representations of pigments, both as efficient RGB-based representations, and as more accurate, but less efficient, arbitrary spectral representations.
